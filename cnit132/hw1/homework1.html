  <p>About me: My name is Monica and I am an SF native. I like to keep up to date with technology because it's constantly changing and there may be more interesting and efficient ways to do things. I enjoy learning new things and keeping my skills up
    to date. I enjoy hiking with my dog, traveling, doing crafts, and have an unhealthy addiction to drinking bubble tea (boba). </p>
  <p>My path to web development started in high school when I started teaching myself HTML. Then I got an internship with the City and County of SF, and learned how to use FTP to make updates to the
    <a href="https://sfgov.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SFGov.org website</a>. Several years later, I work as a web developer in tech but I need to improve my CSS skills and approach things that are more semantic and logical whether it be naminc conventions
    or using the correct classes for specific elements. </p>
    <p>My favorite website is: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacker News</a> because the layout and design are easy to digest and everything is intuitive. The aggregated news snippets about computer science and entrepreneurship are easily digestable and people can vote by assigning points to the articles but you need to have accumulated your own points in order to vote. Here's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News">wiki article</a> that explains the site in more detail. The site is similar to Reddit. </p>
  <p>To get some good help, advice, support, tips, assistance, and guidance. It would be beneficial to visit the CCSF Counseling Team. See <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#subcontent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Counseling</a>.
