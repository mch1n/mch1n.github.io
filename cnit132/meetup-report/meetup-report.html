<p>I participated in the online meetup hosted by PunchCode based in Las Vegas. I attended the online version since SF still has shelter-in-place due to COVID-19.</p>

<h2>Details of the meetup:</h2>

<p>Tuesday, March 24, 2020</p>

<p>Free ONLINE Crash Course - Intro to Front End Engineering w/ JavaScript</p>

<p>Hosted by: <a href="https://punchcode.org" target="_blank">PunchCode</a></p>

<p><a href="https://punchcode.org" target="_blank">PunchCode</a> is a coding bootcamp provided by Tech Impact. Tech Impact is a nonprofit whose mission is to empower communities and nonprofits to use technology to better serve our world. PunchCode holds these meetups once a month to get people to check out their coding bootcamp and to get people more interested in learning to become software engineers.</p>

<p>The online meetup was an introductory crash course in Javascript. The first half was an brief intro to the various types of JS variables, comparison operators, conditional statements, and a brief overview of functions:
Primitve types (compared by value - immutable, so no way to change after it's created)</p>
<ul>
<li>Number</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>Boolean</li>
<li>Null</li>
<li>Undefined</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-primitve types (compared by reference  - mutable, so value can change after it's created)</p>
<ul>
<li>Array</li>
<li>Objects - functions </li>
</ul>

<p>Comparison operators (some examples)</p>
<ul>
<li>=, ==, ===, &gt;, &lt;, !=, +, -, *, /, &amp;&amp;, ||</li>
</ul>

<p>Conditional statements</p>
<ul>
<li>if-else statements</li>
<li>for loops</li>
<li>while loops</li>
</ul>

<p>There was also a demo of a JS number game where you guess a number and the game will give you hints if you're close to the number or not.</p>

<p>Code was hosted on codepen and he went through the various functions of the game. From defining variables, using Math.random(), and Submit event listener and then a function to capture the submit event. There was also conditional statements to check if the number was correct or keep guessing a lower or higher number. </p>

<p>Overall, it was a very informative session, and it was a good overview intro to JS.</p>
