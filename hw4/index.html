        <p>From the class lecture, a <strong>Progressive Web App</strong> is a methodology that combines different technologies to make powerful web applications. Additionally, according to Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell, <em>"It is a set of best practices to make a web application function similar to a desktop or mobile application. The dream is to have an experience so uniform and seamless that the user is unable to tell the difference between a Progressive Web App and a native mobile app".</em></p>
        <p>
        <select id="background-selector" class="custom-select" onchange="changeBkgdColor()">
          <option selected>Please select a background</option>
          <option class="lt-blue" value="lt-blue">Light blue</option>
          <option class="lt-gold" value="lt-gold">Light gold</option>
        </select>
      </p>
<p>Progressive Web Apps tend to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fast - you can cache the data and start the app without having to fetch data from the network </li>
  <li>Integrated user experiecne - PWAs behave like native apps, sit in the phone's home screen and sends push notifications</li>
  <li>Reliable experience - using service workers, certain data is cached if network connection is lost</li>
  <li>Engaging - using push notifications, the user is always engaged with the app</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic requirements to create a PWA:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a manifest file — manifest.json: It has meta information about the app like icon name, background color, the name of the app, etc. </li>
  <li>service worker with at least a fetch event — serviceworker.js: A service worker will help us cache data and fetch resources. </li>
  <li>icon — various sizes which a user sees after installing it in their app drawer</li>
  <li>served over HTTPS: It establishes your web application as a trusted site for users demonstrating trust and reliability, and avoiding middle man attacks.</li>
</ul>
